        Jerathel Jean and Kenyatta Young were hopelessly looking for love on <a href="https://bbwcupid.com" target="_blank">bbwcupid.com</a> and other dating sites 
        when they crossed paths one Monday morning. 
        Jerathel made the first move, and Kenyatta quickly reciprocated the interest. 
        It began with a simple exchange 
        of information, which quickly led to the discovery that these two shared something that was so uncommon, 
        that it immediately posed the question,
        is this meant to be?  Jerathel and Kenyatta were both born on July 12, 
        there shared birthday was one of many commonalities that was revealed on the never-ending night.

        even though there were hundreds of miles between them, they were already inseparable.
